Big Muff on 2n5088
=================
Clone of Big Muff Pi,  a fuzzbox produced in New York City by the Electro-Harmonix company, along with their Russian sister company Sovtek, primarily for use with the electric guitar. It is used by bassists as well due to the Big Muff's low end frequency response.
